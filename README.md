# salman-ahmed-abbasi-test

I have completed the given task given below is the step by step way to run the project

1. Clone the link or download the files from the current repository.
2. Make sure to install all the node modules using 'npm install' command before running the project.
3. Once the node modules are installed run command 'npm start' to run the project.

# My Approach

I have used react js as my front-end framework and used sass for styling. All the components used in the project are clearly shown.
As I am relatively new to writing unit test codes I have written tests for a couple of components using jest.js and react-test-render.

Type the name of the artist of your choice and a card will appear if the artist exists. Simply Click on the artists to see whether it has 
events or not.

Note: I have only searched results for the upcoming events in the API only.

# Deploying(for bonus section)

I would simply create a production build by using 'npm run build' command. What it does is that it creates a build folder as you can see in the project which contains all the minified and combine js,css also an index.html file which we setup on our server.
